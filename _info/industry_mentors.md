# Industry Mentor Visits

## Overview for industry mentor volunteers

Seeking: volunteers working in software development to visit a UCSB software development class (CS56) for three hours, 4pm-7pm on March 1st. 

Your role will be to ask students to describe their project to you in terms of the overall purpose, (including a demo), description of the issues they are working on, and an informal code review.

All we ask of you is to ask them questions--whatever questions you think are interesting and/or important, and to answer theirs about "real world code".

You may feel free give them feedback and advice if you have any that you think is helpful, but don't feel like you "must" do this.

Accordingly, Java experience/expertise helpful, but not required--if you aren't up on Java, you can still help with overall software dev process stuff, UX stuff, general code style issues, etc.

Similarly, being a UCSB CS alum, and more specifically, one that took CS56 with Conrad is helpful, but not required.

You'll meet with between 4 and 6 pairs over the three hours, so you'll have between 20-40 minutes with each.

## Overview for students

Before lab on March 1st, please prepare to share the following with your industry mentor:

* a 60-120 second description of the big picture of your project
* a 3-5 minute demo of what works, and what doesn't work yet
* a 3-5 minute explanation of the issues you've completed so far, and what else you plan to do before the quarter is done
* at least two, but no more than three questions for the mentor.  They could be about code, about the software industry in general.

Your session with the mentor will start there, and then it will be up to you and the mentor how to use the rest of your time.

When you are finished, you'll be asked to write a few reflections.  A link to instructions for that will appear here. (INSERT LINK HERE).
