This lab counts 300 points towards your lab grade.

This lab MUST BE DONE IN PERSON WITH YOUR MENTOR during your week 09 lab section.

# Issues for the next generation of CS56 students 

To complete this lab, and be DONE with the legacy code project, you need to do EACH of these things:

0.  Make a new proj03 branch, based on your last proj02 branch.

1.  (50 pts) Do some final edits in the README.md file of your legacy code
    project.  Put in a section called "{{site.qtr}} final remarks" and in
    it, write a short "note" to the next set of students that will work on
    this legacy code project.

    Tell them exactly what you think would be helpful for them to know
    as they start the project: what the code does, what features could
    be added, what bugs exist, what opportunities for refactoring you
    see.   Also add any advice you have on working with the code you have
    left them, for with legacy code in general.
    
2.  (250 pts) Add a new <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> file that contains
    links to 500  points of issues for the next generation of CS56 students to work on.

    Link to the issue, and note how many points it is approved for, and show that this adds up to 500.

    You earn 1 point for every 2 points of issues that are referred to in this file.
    
    These may be issues that you came up with, or they may be issues
    left over from ones you mentor added, or a combination.   Regardless
    of how the issues got there, there should be at least `500` points
    worth of them.

    Note, however that for issues to count towards the 500 points,
    they must have a <tt>"{{site.qtr}} OK"</tt>  comment from your mentor, another mentor,
    a TA or an instructor.  Leftover `"M16 OK"` or `"W16 OK"` etc. comments do not count.
    And you MUST be in lab IN PERSON to get this `"OK"`. (See below).
    
    If you don't get this OK by {{page.due}} then
    the points don't count.
    
3.  (0 pts) Do a pull request from this branch, and then GET YOUR MENTOR'S OK ON IT during lab before you leave the room. Note that this is worth 0 points, but if you don't do it, you run the risk of getting no credit for this lab.   
    
4.  OPTIONAL, NOT GRADED, BUT STRONGLY ENCOURAGED: review all your final pull requests with your mentor, and review the feeback repos also, to ensure that any and all concerns about your project grades are dealt with.   THIS MEETING IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT PROJECT GRADES.   After this, the mentors and TAs are no longer available (we typically have one extra week to do this, but with the compressed 9 week quarter, we don't this time.)
    
# Additional Notes    
    
*    NOTE THAT YOU MUST discuss the new issues FACE TO FACE with your mentor IN LAB.  

     You
     cannot rely on your pair partner to do this.  If only one pair partner
     shows up, on that THAT pair partner will get the credit for this
     lab.

     Make sure that your mentor has signed off with an <tt>"{{site.qtr}} OK"</tt> comment
     on each issue that you are planning to count towards this 500.
     
# Grading

* (50 pts): `README.md` note to next set of students.  
* (250 pts): 500 points of issues remaining for the next generation of students on the main fork of your legacy code project.
    * Each issue must have an <tt>"{{site.qtr}} OK"</tt> comment from a mentor (comments from previous quarters do not count.)
    * Any issue not ok'd by mentor by the due date/time of this lab DOES NOT COUNT.
    * The issues *do not count* unless they are linked to in a <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> file with the list of issues for the next CS56 class of students.
    *  There should be a pull request for these changes to the `README.md` and <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> file from a proj03 branch.
