# Three ways to switch projects

(1) Be assigned a project from the pool of available projects that weren't assigned to anyone.


(2) Be assigned one that someone else has abandoned.

(3) Propose a new greenfield project.  [Instructions for proposing a new project appear here](/lab/proposal01/)

NOTE: Do not start these steps until your switch to a new legacy project is CONFIRMED and recorded by your mentor in the spreadsheet linked to from the main course website.

# If you are taking over a different legacy code project than the one you were initially assigned

## Make a new version of {{site.qtr}}\_proj00.md 

If you are switching to a different legacy code project from the one that you worked on during the initial code review,
then you should first, for 250 points towards your project points, make a version of the {{site.qtr}}\_proj00.md file 
for the new repo to which you are assigned.

This will involve forking the new repo you are assigned to, following the instructions from [proj00](/lab/proj00/).

This will help you get oriented to the new repo that you are now working on.

You should also be sure that your mentor updates their records of which repo you are working on.

It is unlikely that you will be assigned to a different mentor, but if
that does happen, due to changes in pair assignments, please make sure
your mentor has this updated information.

*Note to mentors:* Please be sure to update whatever pages on the
 website, spreadsheets, etc. we may be using to track the assignments
 of students to pairs and legacy code projects, and double check as
 part of this lab, that all of those are up-to-date.
 
Students: Please have your mentor add a special "issue" to the
UCSB-CS56-Projects version of the new repo you are working on for 250
points for completing this new version of the {{site.qtr}}\_proj00.md
file.

# Then, get on with the code changes.

From that point, you should be able to follow the rest of the
instructions just as if you had been working on this repo from the
start.  Note that because of this extra orientation step, you'll be a
little "behind" the pace you would have been on if you had continued
with the same repo.  But we have made up for that by awarding 250
points for redoing the repo orientation step.  Because of earning 250
points for that, you are now only requiredto complete 250 points of
coding issues for this round of work on the legacy code project
instead of 500.  You will still have to complete at least 500 beyond
that by the end of the course.
